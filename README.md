How Java works:
1.As a program when we write the program ,compiler convert this code into byte code which is executed by jvm and provide the desired output.
2.jvm is part of JRE which is nothing but java runtime environment which is required to run any java program alog with some others libraries
3.Java is platform independent due to JRE because we can write once and run anywhere
4.both JRE and JVM are the part of JDK which is required to develop java application.
