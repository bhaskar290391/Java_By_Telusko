/* 
Mastering Loops in Java: For, While, and Do-While in Action

Write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using three different loop types:

for loop

while loop

do-while loop

Each loop should run independently and print its result on a single line, clearly labeled. Numbers should be printed with spaces between them and no trailing space at the end.



Instructions:

Use a for loop when the number of iterations is fixed (1 to 5).

Use a while loop to repeat the same logic with a counter.

Use a do-while loop to show that it runs at least once.

Each loop's output should be labeled (e.g., "For Loop: 1 2 3 4 5").

Use System.out.print() to format the output properly.



Expected Output:

  For Loop:  1  2  3  4  5

  While Loop:  1  2  3  4  5

  Do-While Loop:  1  2  3  4  5
