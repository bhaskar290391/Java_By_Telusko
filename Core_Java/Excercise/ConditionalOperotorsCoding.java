/*
    Student Performance Evaluation Using If-Else in Java

Write a Java program to evaluate a student's performance using if-else and else-if statements.

You are given the following:

An integer variable score = 75

A character variable grade = 'B'

Your task is to:

Use if-else to check if the student passed or failed.

A score of 50 or above is considered a pass.

Print "Passed" or "Failed" accordingly.

Use else-if conditions to assign and print a grade based on the score:

A for 90 and above

B for 75 to 89

C for 60 to 74

D for below 60

Use System.out.println() to clearly display the output.

Instructions:

The variables score and grade are already declared for you.

Use if-else to evaluate pass/fail status.

Use else-if to assign and print the grade based on the score.

Ensure the output formatting matches the example output.

Do not use ternary or switch statements in this exercise.



Expected Output:

  Passed

  Grade:  B
